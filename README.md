# Help Scout Docs Shortcode for WordPress

Because the Help Scout Docs are not compliant with GDPR I created this shortcode to render the contents of articles in WordPress posts/pages using a shortcode.

Yes, it requires quite a bit of manual labor, but it has a few perks:

- **SEO**: You can decide the URL structure yourself, which makes it much more attractive to search bots.
- **Use your site's layout**: You're working in WordPress, which increases recognizability for your users!
- **Keep using Help Scout**: Keep using that awesome tool, because similar alternatives like ZenDesk are waaay too expensive!
